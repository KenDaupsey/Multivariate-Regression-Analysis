Multivariate Regression Analysis

This repository hosts a comprehensive exploration of multivariate regression analysis techniques using Python. It covers various aspects, including multiple linear regression, comparing linear, lasso, and ridge regressions, and examining regression and variance inflation factor (VIF).

Multiple Linear Regression

Begin with multiple linear regression analysis, importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. Categorical gender data is converted for analysis, followed by a detailed procedure for multiple linear regression, including defining independent and dependent variables and fitting the model. The regression summary is printed to provide insights into the model's performance.

Comparing Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regressions

Explore the comparison between linear, lasso, and ridge regressions, both with single and multiple variables. This section imports required libraries and performs one-hot encoding for categorical variables. It then fits various regression models, including simple linear, multiple linear, lasso, and ridge regressions, and evaluates their performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared.

Regression and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

Delve into the concept of regression and variance inflation factor (VIF), crucial for assessing multicollinearity among independent variables. The dataset is loaded, and categorical variables are encoded. A multiple regression model is fitted, and the regression summary is printed. Additionally, the VIF for each independent variable is calculated and displayed, providing insights into multicollinearity issues.

Explore these techniques and analyses to gain a comprehensive understanding of multivariate regression and its applications in Python.
