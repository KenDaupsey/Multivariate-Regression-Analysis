Regression Analysis Project
This project conducts regression analysis on student dataset hsb2 to understand factors influencing math scores.

Analysis
Several regression techniques are implemented:

Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Both single predictor and multiple predictor models are fit and evaluated.

Additionally, variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis is performed to check for multicollinearity among predictors.

Key Files
regression_analysis.py: Core analysis script
hsb2.csv: Dataset file
output.txt: Text output from regression models
Results
Multiple regression models outperform single predictor models
Multiple linear regression has best performance overall
VIF values indicate some multicollinearity present
Conclusion
The analysis quantifies the effects of variables like reading and writing scores, demographics etc. on math scores. The linear model explains 60% variance. Further analysis into causes of multicollinearity may improve model robustness.

Copy


is the title :"Multivariate Regression Analysis" good?

OK write a one sentence Description of the project and then write a one paragraph summary of the readme

KM
Here is a one sentence description of the project:

The project performs linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, and variance inflation factor analysis to model the relationship between various student factors and math scores.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the README:

The README documents a regression analysis project focused on predicting math scores using the 'hsb2' student dataset, with techniques including simple linear, multiple linear, lasso, and ridge regression. It outlines the key files containing code, data, and outputs for the analysis which fits both single variable and multivariate models, then evaluates performance to find the multiple linear regression has the best fit. Additionally it checks for multicollinearity issues with variance inflation factor analysis. The README summarizes that the project quantifies variable effects on math scores, explains 60% of variance with the linear model, and points out further investigation into causes of collinearity could potentially improve model robustness.
